📊 Code Analysis of Kolam Mathematical Principle Identifier - Enhanced MVP 2
I've created a comprehensive, user-friendly mathematical analysis tool for Kolam patterns. Here's the detailed analysis:
🏗️ Architecture Overview
Core Components:

Data Structures - Clean object-oriented design with Point, KolamPattern, AnalysisResult classes
Mathematical Analyzers - Specialized classes for different mathematical aspects
Interactive Interface - User-friendly input/output system
Visualization Engine - Comprehensive plotting and analysis display

🔬 Mathematical Analysis Capabilities
Fibonacci & Spiral Analysis:

Detects Fibonacci spiral patterns by analyzing growth ratios
Compares growth ratios against golden ratio (1.618)
Calculates spiral arms and mathematical harmony scores
Algorithm: Polar coordinate transformation → ratio analysis → golden ratio comparison

Grid Classification System:

Square Grid: Detects 90° angular relationships
Hexagonal Grid: Identifies 120° patterns (most efficient natural structure)
Triangular Grid: Recognizes 60° tessellations
Circular Grid: Analyzes radial uniformity
Method: Distance uniformity analysis + angular distribution + geometric heuristics

Symmetry Detection:

Tests reflection symmetry across multiple axes (every 15°)
Counts symmetry axes automatically
Algorithm: Point reflection mathematics + tolerance-based matching

Complexity Scoring:

Formula: (base_complexity + symmetry_bonus) × density_factor
Factors: dot count, connections, symmetry types, connection density
Scale: 0-10 with mathematical justification
